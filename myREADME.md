# weather-dashboard
Weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This application still has a few bugs that need to be worked through to satisfy the user experience. For example the UV index has not been incorporated. Another shortfall, is that when a searched city is added, all previous searches are looped through and added to the page causing a repeat * the number of items that have been searched. I believe that that the local storage is persistent, but I need more feedback in this area. I feel that the layout is responsive to for small medium and large screen sizes.
